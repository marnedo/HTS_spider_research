Phylogenetic Systematics and Evolution of the Spider Infraorder Mygalomorphae Using Genomic Scale Data,V. Opatova; C. A. Hamilton; M. Hedin; L. M. Montes de Oca; J. Křál; J. E. Bond; B. Wiegmann,10.1093/sysbio/syz064,,Systematic Biology,,2020,"The infraorder Mygalomorphae is one of the three main lineages of spiders comprising over 3000 nominal species. This ancient group has a worldwide distribution that includes among its ranks large and charismatic taxa such as tarantulas, trapdoor spiders, and highly venomous funnel-web spiders. Based on past molecular studies using Sanger-sequencing approaches, numerous mygalomorph families (e.g., Hexathelidae, Ctenizidae, Cyrtaucheniidae, Dipluridae, and Nemesiidae) have been identified as non-monophyletic. However, these data were unable to sufficiently resolve the higher-level (intra- and interfamilial) relationships such that the necessary changes in classification could be made with confidence. Here, we present a comprehensive phylogenomic treatment of the spider infraorder Mygalomorphae. We employ 472 loci obtained through anchored hybrid enrichment to reconstruct relationships among all the mygalomorph spider families and estimate the timeframe of their diversification. We sampled nearly all currently recognized families, which has allowed us to assess their status, and as a result, propose a new classification scheme. Our generic-level sampling has also provided an evolutionary framework for revisiting questions regarding silk use in mygalomorph spiders. The first such analysis for the group within a strict phylogenetic framework shows that a sheet web is likely the plesiomorphic condition for mygalomorphs, as well as providing insights to the ancestral foraging behavior for all spiders. Our divergence time estimates, concomitant with detailed biogeographic analysis, suggest that both ancient continental-level vicariance and more recent dispersal events have played an important role in shaping modern day distributional patterns. Based on our results, we relimit the generic composition of the Ctenizidae, Cyrtaucheniidae, Dipluridae, and Nemesiidae. We also elevate five subfamilies to family rank: Anamidae (NEW RANK), Euagridae (NEW RANK), Ischnothelidae (NEW RANK), Pycnothelidae (NEW RANK), and Bemmeridae (NEW RANK). Three families Entypesidae (NEW FAMILY), Microhexuridae (NEW FAMILY), and Stasimopidae (NEW FAMILY), and one subfamily Australothelinae (NEW SUBFAMILY) are newly proposed. Such a major rearrangement in classification, recognizing nine newly established family-level rank taxa, is the largest the group has seen in over three decades.

Reassessing the evolutionary relationships of tropical wandering spiders using phylogenomics: A UCE-based phylogeny of Ctenidae (Araneae) with the discovery of a new lycosoid family,N. A. Hazzi; H. M. Wood; G. Hormiga,10.1016/j.ympev.2024.108245,,Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution,,2025,"Tropical wandering spiders (Ctenidae) are a diverse family of cursorial predators whose species richness peaks in the tropics. The phylogeny of Ctenidae has been examined using morphology and Sanger-based sequencing data, but these studies have been limited by taxon sampling and have often recovered low branch support for many intrafamilial phylogenetic relationships. Herein, we present the most extensive phylogenetic sampling of this family using genome-scale data, leveraging museum collections of all ctenid subfamilies from across the world. We obtained a well-resolved phylogeny of Ctenidae, with the majority of nodes showing maximal nodal support and topological congruence across different phylogenetic analyses. For the first time, we show with high support that Ancylometes is not within Ctenidae but is the sister lineage to all the remaining lycosoid families. Therefore, we propose Ancylometidae as a new family. We assess the phylogenetic position of Ctenidae within Lycosoidea using a variety of phylogenetic methods and tests, demonstrating that the previously proposed position of Ctenidae as the sister clade of Psechridae, based on phylotranscriptomic analyses, lacks phylogenetic support. As a new finding, this study shows that the subfamily Acantheinae, as currently delimited, is polyphyletic. Therefore, we erect the new ctenid subfamily Enoplocteninae to accommodate the Neotropical genera Enoploctenus, Chococtenus, and Phymatoctenus. Our phylogenomic results using UCE data resolve the position of several problematic genera (e.g., Califorctenus and Acantheis) and add support to other parts of the tree that received low support in the most recent Sanger-based phylogeny.

A trade-off in evolution: The adaptive landscape of spiders without venom glands,Y. Zhang; Y. Shen; P. Jin; B. Zhu; Y. Lin; T. Jiang; X. Huang; Y. Wang; Z. Zhao; S. Li,10.1093/gigascience/giae048,,GigaScience,,2024,"Background: Venom glands play a key role in the predation and defense strategies of almost all spider groups. However, the spider family Uloboridae lacks venom glands and has evolved an adaptive strategy: they excessively wrap their prey directly with spider silk instead of paralyzing it first with toxins. This shift in survival strategy is very fascinating, but the genetic underpinnings behind it are poorly understood. Results: Spanning multiple spider groups, we conducted multiomics analyses on Octonoba sinensis and described the adaptive evolution of the Uloboridae family at the genome level. We observed the coding genes of myosin and twitchin in muscles are under positive selection, energy metabolism functions are enhanced, and gene families related to tracheal development and tissue mechanical strength are expanded or emerged, all of which are related to the unique anatomical structure and predatory behavior of spiders in the family Uloboridae. In addition, we also scanned the elements that are absent or under relaxed purifying selection, as well as toxin gene homologs in the genomes of 2 species in this family. The results show that the absence of regions and regions under relaxed selection in these spiders' genomes are concentrated in areas related to development and neurosystem. The search for toxin homologs reveals possible gene function shift between toxins and nontoxins and confirms that there are no reliable toxin genes in the genome of this group. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the trade-off between different predation strategies in spiders, using either chemical or physical strategy, and provides insights into the possible mechanism underlying this trade-off. Venomless spiders need to mobilize multiple developmental and metabolic pathways related to motor function and limb mechanical strength to cover the decline in adaptability caused by the absence of venom glands. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Genomes,Chromosome-level,DNBSEQ,DNBSEQ,?,Hi-C,

House spider genome uncovers evolutionary shifts in the diversity and expression of black widow venom proteins associated with extreme toxicity,K. L. Gendreau; R. A. Haney; E. E. Schwager; T. Wierschin; M. Stanke; S. Richards; J. E. Garb,10.1186/s12864-017-3551-7,,BMC Genomics,,2017,"Background: Black widow spiders are infamous for their neurotoxic venom, which can cause extreme and long-lasting pain. This unusual venom is dominated by latrotoxins and latrodectins, two protein families virtually unknown outside of the black widow genus Latrodectus, that are difficult to study given the paucity of spider genomes. Using tissue-, sex- and stage-specific expression data, we analyzed the recently sequenced genome of the house spider (Parasteatoda tepidariorum), a close relative of black widows, to investigate latrotoxin and latrodectin diversity, expression and evolution. Results: We discovered at least 47 latrotoxin genes in the house spider genome, many of which are tandem-arrayed. Latrotoxins vary extensively in predicted structural domains and expression, implying their significant functional diversification. Phylogenetic analyses show latrotoxins have substantially duplicated after the Latrodectus/Parasteatoda split and that they are also related to proteins found in endosymbiotic bacteria. Latrodectin genes are less numerous than latrotoxins, but analyses show their recruitment for venom function from neuropeptide hormone genes following duplication, inversion and domain truncation. While latrodectins and other peptides are highly expressed in house spider and black widow venom glands, latrotoxins account for a far smaller percentage of house spider venom gland expression. Conclusions: The house spider genome sequence provides novel insights into the evolution of venom toxins once considered unique to black widows. Our results greatly expand the size of the latrotoxin gene family, reinforce its narrow phylogenetic distribution, and provide additional evidence for the lateral transfer of latrotoxins between spiders and bacterial endosymbionts. Moreover, we strengthen the evidence for the evolution of latrodectin venom genes from the ecdysozoan Ion Transport Peptide (ITP)/Crustacean Hyperglycemic Hormone (CHH) neuropeptide superfamily. The lower expression of latrotoxins in house spiders relative to black widows, along with the absence of a vertebrate-targeting α-latrotoxin gene in the house spider genome, may account for the extreme potency of black widow venom. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Genomes,Scaffold,Illumina,Illumina,?,?,
Genomic and transcriptomic analyses support a silk gland origin of spider venom glands,B. Zhu; P. Jin; Y. Zhang; Y. Shen; W. Wang; S. Li,10.1186/s12915-023-01581-7,,BMC Biology,,2023,"Background: Spiders comprise a hyperdiverse lineage of predators with venom systems, yet the origin of functionally novel spider venom glands remains unclear. Previous studies have hypothesized that spider venom glands originated from salivary glands or evolved from silk-producing glands present in early chelicerates. However, there is insufficient molecular evidence to indicate similarity among them. Here, we provide comparative analyses of genome and transcriptome data from various lineages of spiders and other arthropods to advance our understanding of spider venom gland evolution. Results: We generated a chromosome-level genome assembly of a model spider species, the common house spider (Parasteatoda tepidariorum). Module preservation, GO semantic similarity, and differentially upregulated gene similarity analyses demonstrated a lower similarity in gene expressions between the venom glands and salivary glands compared to the silk glands, which questions the validity of the salivary gland origin hypothesis but unexpectedly prefers to support the ancestral silk gland origin hypothesis. The conserved core network in the venom and silk glands was mainly correlated with transcription regulation, protein modification, transport, and signal transduction pathways. At the genetic level, we found that many genes in the venom gland-specific transcription modules show positive selection and upregulated expressions, suggesting that genetic variation plays an important role in the evolution of venom glands. Conclusions: This research implies the unique origin and evolutionary path of spider venom glands and provides a basis for understanding the diverse molecular characteristics of venom systems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Genomes,Chromosome-level,Illumina,Illumina,Novaseq 6000 ,Hi-C,
The Nephila clavipes genome highlights the diversity of spider silk genes and their complex expression,P. L. Babb; N. F. Lahens; S. M. Correa-Garhwal; D. N. Nicholson; E. J. Kim; J. B. Hogenesch; M. Kuntner; L. Higgins; C. Y. Hayashi; I. Agnarsson,10.1038/ng.3852,,Nature Genetics,,2017,"Spider silks are the toughest known biological materials, yet are lightweight and virtually invisible to the human immune system, and they thus have revolutionary potential for medicine and industry. Spider silks are largely composed of spidroins, a unique family of structural proteins. To investigate spidroin genes systematically, we constructed the first genome of an orb-weaving spider: the golden orb-weaver (Nephila clavipes), which builds large webs using an extensive repertoire of silks with diverse physical properties. We cataloged 28 Nephila spidroins, representing all known orb-weaver spidroin types, and identified 394 repeated coding motif variants and higher-order repetitive cassette structures unique to specific spidroins. Characterization of spidroin expression in distinct silk gland types indicates that glands can express multiple spidroin types. We find evidence of an alternatively spliced spidroin, a spidroin expressed only in venom glands, evolutionary mechanisms for spidroin diversification, and non-spidroin genes with expression patterns that suggest roles in silk production. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Genomes,Scaffold,Illumina,Illumina,?,Hybrid,

However, the evolutionary origin of repeated phenotypes can be difficult to disentangle as it can arise from a combination of factors such as gene flow, shared ancestral polymorphisms or mutation. Here, we investigate the presence of these evolutionary processes in the Hawaiian spiny-leg Tetragnatha adaptive radiation, which includes four microhabitat-specialists or ecomorphs, with different body pigmentation and size (Green, Large Brown, Maroon, and Small Brown). We investigated the evolutionary history of this radiation using 76 newly generated low-coverage, whole-genome resequenced samples, along with phylogenetic and population genomic tools. Considering the Green ecomorph as the ancestral state, our results suggest that the Green ecomorph likely re-evolved once, the Large Brown and Maroon ecomorphs evolved twice and the Small Brown evolved three times. We found that the evolution of the Maroon and Small Brown ecomorphs likely involved ancestral hybridization events, while the Green and Large Brown ecomorphs likely evolved through novel mutations, despite a high rate of incomplete lineage sorting in the dataset.

Comparative mitogenomics of Cheiracanthium species (Araneae: Cheiracanthiidae) with phylogenetic implication and evolutionary insights,Z. Li; F. Zhang,10.7717/peerj.18314,,PeerJ,,2025,"The genus Cheiracanthium C. L. Koch, 1839 is the most species-rich genus of the family Cheiracanthiidae. Given the unavailability of information on the evolutionary biology and molecular taxonomy of this genus, here we sequenced nine mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) of Cheiracanthium species, four of which were fully annotated, and conducted comparative analyses with other well-characterized Araneae mitogenomes. We also provide phylogenetic insights on the genus Cheiracanthium. The circular mitogenomes of the Cheiracanthium contain 37 genes, including 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNA genes (tRNAs), two ribosomal RNA genes (rRNAs) and one putative control region (CR). All genes show a high A+T bias, characterized by a negative AT skew and positive GC skew, along with numerous overlapped regions and intergenic spacers. Approximately half of the tRNAs lack T9C and/or dihydrouracil (DHU) arm and are characterized with unpaired amino acid acceptor arms. Most PCGs used the standard ATN start codons and TAR termination codons. The mitochondrial gene order of Cheiracanthium differs significantly from the putative ancestral gene order (Limulus polyphemus). Our novel phylogenetic analyses infer Cheiracanthiidae to be the sister group of Salticidae in BI analysis, but as sister to the node with Miturgidae, Viridasiidae, Corinnidae, Selenopidae, Salticidae, and Philodromidae in ML analysis. We confirm that Cheiracanthium is paraphyletic, for the first time using molecular phylogenetic approaches, with the earliest divergence estimated at 67 Ma. Our findings enhance our understanding of Cheiracanthium taxonomy and evolution. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Genomes,Mitogenome,Illumina,Illumina,Novaseq 6000 ,"Low coverage, in silico Transcriptomes, UCE",Low coverage
Impact of environmental factors on spider silk properties,C. Hopfe; B. Ospina-Jara; T. Schulze; M. Tischer; D. Morales; V. Reinhartz; R. E. Esfahani; C. Valderrama; J. Pérez-Rigueiro; C. Bleidorn,10.1016/j.cub.2023.11.043,,Current Biology,,2024,"Spider orb webs have evolved to stop flying prey, fast and slow alike. One of the main web elements dissipating impact energy is the radial fibers, or major ampullate silks, which possess a toughness surpassing most man-made materials. Orb webs are extended phenotypes, and as such their architectural elements, including major ampullate silks, have been selected to optimize prey capture under the respective environmental conditions. In this study, we investigated the correlation of three landscape scales and three microhabitat characteristics with intrinsic silk properties (elastic modulus, yield stress, tensile strength, extensibility, and toughness) to understand underlying ecological patterns. For this purpose, we collected and mechanically tested major ampullate silks from 50 spider species inhabiting large altitudinal and climatic gradients in Colombia. Using regression analysis and model selection, we investigated the environmental drivers of inter- and intra-specific patterns of major ampullate silk properties, taking into account phylogenetic relatedness based on newly sequenced mitochondrial genomes. We found that the total amount of energy absorbed, i.e., toughness and tensile strength, is higher for fibers from species inhabiting regions where heavy rainfall is common. Interestingly, we observe the same general trend between individuals of the same species, stressing the importance of this environmental driver. We also observe a phylogenetic conservation in the relation of environmental variables with silk tensile strength and yield stress. In conclusion, the increase in major ampullate silk tensile strength and toughness may reflect an adaptation to prevent frequent rain damage to orb webs and the associated energetic loss. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Phylogenomics,Deep,Illumina,Illumina,Novaseq 6000 ,"Low coverage, mitogenomes",Low coverage

Tyagi; K. Chandra,10.1038/s41598-019-57065-8,,Scientific Reports,,2020,"The complete mitochondrial genome of Lyrognathus crotalus is sequenced, annotated and compared with other spider mitogenomes. It is 13,865 bp long and featured by 22 transfer RNA genes (tRNAs), and two ribosomal RNA genes (rRNAs), 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), and a control region (CR). Most of the PCGs used ATN start codon except cox3, and nad4 with TTG. Comparative studies indicated the use of TTG, TTA, TTT, GTG, CTG, CTA as start codons by few PCGs. Most of the tRNAs were truncated and do not fold into the typical cloverleaf structure. Further, the motif (CATATA) was detected in CR of nine species including L. crotalus. The gene arrangement of L. crotalus compared with ancestral arthropod showed the transposition of five tRNAs and one tandem duplication random loss (TDRL) event. Five plesiomophic gene blocks (A-E) were identified, of which, four (A, B, D, E) retained in all taxa except family Salticidae. However, block C was retained in Mygalomorphae and two families of Araneomorphae (Hypochilidae and Pholcidae). Out of 146 derived gene boundaries in all taxa, 15 synapomorphic gene boundaries were identified. TreeREx analysis also revealed the transposition of trnI, which makes three derived boundaries and congruent with the result of the gene boundary mapping. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference showed similar topologies and congruent with morphology, and previously reported multi-gene phylogeny. However, the Gene-Order based phylogeny showed sister relationship of L. crotalus with two Araneomorphae family members (Hypochilidae and Pholcidae) and other Mygalomorphae species. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Genomes,Mitogenome,Illumina,Illumina,HiSeq2500,"Low coverage, mitogenomes",Low coverage
The gene arrangement and phylogeny using mitochondrial genomes in spiders (Arachnida: Araneae),K. Tyagi; V. Kumar; N. Poddar; P. Prasad; I. Tyagi; S. Kundu; K. Chandra,10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.01.014,,International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,,2020,"The complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of Cheiracanthium triviale was sequenced for the first time. The 14,595 bp C. triviale mitogenome contained 37 genes (13 protein coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNAs, 22 transfer RNAs) and one control region. The mitogenome of Dysdera silvatica which was available at NCBI GenBank was annotated. The mitogenome of C. triviale was compared with 43 previously sequenced spider species to observe the gene arrangements, control region and phylogeny. TreeREx analysis identified 19 mitochondrial gene rearrangements (11 transposition, 6 inversion, 2 inverse transposition) in spiders as compared with the putative ancestral gene order and lead to form new gene boundaries: trnQ-trnA, trnA-trnM for Loxosceles similis; nad3-trnS1, trnE-trnL2, trnL2-trnA, trnN-trnF for Agelena silvatica; trnN-trnE, trnE-trnA, trnR-trnF, nad4L-trnW, trnW-trnP for Carrhotus xanthogramma; trnQ-trnW, trnW-trnG, trnG-trnM for Tetragnatha nitens. Our study revealed that the gene rearrangement in spiders with putative ancestor is accelerated in Araneomorphae as compared to Mygalomorphae. Phylogenetic analysis of spiders using mitochondrial sequence data supports the monophyly of two infraorders, and sister relationship of Cheiracanthiidae with Selenopidae and Salticidae.

Mitochondrial phylogenomics provides insights into the phylogeny and evolution of spiders (Arthropoda: Araneae),M. Li; W. T. Chen; Q. L. Zhang; M. Liu; C. W. Xing; Y. Cao; F. Z. Luo; M. L. Yuan,10.24272/j.issn.2095-8137.2021.418,,Zoological Research,,2022,"Spiders are among the most varied terrestrial predators, with highly diverse morphology, ecology, and behavior. Morphological and molecular data have greatly contributed to advances in the phylogeny and evolutionary dynamics of spiders. Here, we performed comprehensive mitochondrial phylogenomics analysis on 78 mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) representing 29 families; of these, 23 species from eight families were newly generated. Mesothelae retained the same gene arrangement as the arthropod ancestor (Limulus polyphemus), while Opisthothelae showed extensive rearrangement, with 12 rearrangement types in transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and control region. Most spider tRNAs were extremely truncated and lacked typical dihydrouridine or TC arms, showing high tRNA structural diversity; in particular, trnS1 exhibited anticodon diversity across the phylogeny. The evolutionary rates of mitochondrial genes were potentially associated with gene rearrangement or truncated tRNAs. Both mitogenomic sequences and rearrangements possessed phylogenetic characteristics, providing a robust backbone for spider phylogeny, as previously reported. The monophyly of suborder, infraorder, retrolateral tibial apophysis clade, and families (except for Pisauridae) was separately supported, and high-level relationships were resolved as (Mesothelae, (Mygalomorphae, (Entelegynae, (Synspermiata, Hypochilidae)))). The phylogenetic positions of several families were also resolved (e.g., Eresidae, Oecobiidae and Titanoecidae). Two reconstructions of ancestral web type obtained almost identical results, indicating that the common ancestor of spiders likely foraged using a silk-lined burrow. This study, the largest mitochondrial phylogenomics analysis of spiders to date, highlights the usefulness of mitogenomic data not only for providing efficient phylogenetic signals for spider phylogeny, but also for characterizing trait diversification in spider evolution. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Phylogenomics,Deep,Illumina,Illumina,NovaSeq,"Low coverage, mitogenomes",Low coverage
The complete mitochondrial genome of the intertidal spider (Desis jiaxiangi) provides novel insights into the adaptive evolution of the mitogenome and the evolution of spiders,F. Li; Y. Lv; Z. Wen; C. Bian; X. Zhang; S. Guo; Q. Shi; D. Li,10.1186/s12862-021-01803-y,,BMC Ecology and Evolution,,2021,"Background: Although almost all extant spider species live in terrestrial environments, a few species live fully submerged in freshwater or seawater. The intertidal spiders (genus Desis) built silk nests within coral crevices can survive submerged in high tides. The diving bell spider, Argyroneta aquatica, resides in a similar dynamic environment but exclusively in freshwater. Given the pivotal role played by mitochondria in supplying most energy for physiological activity via oxidative phosphorylation and the environment, herein we sequenced the complete mitogenome of Desis jiaxiangi to investigate the adaptive evolution of the aquatic spider mitogenomes and the evolution of spiders. Results: We assembled a complete mitogenome of the intertidal spider Desis jiaxiangi and performed comparative mitochondrial analyses of data set comprising of Desis jiaxiangi and other 45 previously published spider mitogenome sequences, including that of Argyroneta aquatica. We found a unique transposition of trnL2 and trnN genes in Desis jiaxiangi. Our robust phylogenetic topology clearly deciphered the evolutionary relationships between Desis jiaxiangi and Argyroneta aquatica as well as other spiders. We dated the divergence of Desis jiaxiangi and Argyroneta aquatica to the late Cretaceous at ~ 98 Ma. Our selection analyses detected a positive selection signal in the nd4 gene of the aquatic branch comprising both Desis jiaxiangi and Argyroneta aquatica. Surprisingly, Pirata subpiraticus, Hypochilus thorelli, and Argyroneta aquatica each had a higher Ka/Ks value in the 13 PCGs dataset among 46 taxa with complete mitogenomes, and these three species also showed positive selection signal in the nd6 gene. Conclusions: Our finding of the unique transposition of trnL2 and trnN genes indicates that these genes may have experienced rearrangements in the history of intertidal spider evolution. The positive selection signals in the nd4 and nd6 genes might enable a better understanding of the spider metabolic adaptations in relation to different environments. Our construction of a novel mitogenome for the intertidal spider thus sheds light on the evolutionary history of spiders and their mitogenomes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Genomes,Mitogenome,Illumina,Illumina,HiSeqX,"Low coverage, mitogenomes",Low coverage
"New Insights into the Origin and Evolution of Mysmenid Spiders (Araneae, Mysmenidae) Based on the First Four Complete Mitochondrial Genomes",S. Liu; S. Wang; Q. Chen; C. Zhou; Y. Lin,10.3390/ani13030497,,Animals,,2023,"The mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) is recognized as an effective molecular marker for studying molecular evolution and phylogeny. The family Mysmenidae is a group of widely distributed and covert-living spiders, of which the mitogenomic information is largely unclear. In this study, we obtained the first four complete mitogenomes of mysmenid spiders (one aboveground species: Trogloneta yuensis, and three cave-dwelling species: T. yunnanense, Yamaneta kehen and Y. paquini). Comparative analyses revealed that their lengths ranged from 13,771 bp (T. yuensis) to 14,223 bp (Y. kehen), containing a standard set of 37 genes and an A + T-rich region with the same gene orientation as other spider species. The mitogenomic size of T. yunnanense was more similar to that of Yamaneta mitogenomes than that of T. yuensis, which might indicate the convergent evolution of cave spiders. High variability was detected between the genera Trogloneta and Yamaneta. The A + T content, the amino acid frequency of protein-coding genes (PCGs) and the secondary structures of tRNAs showed large differences. Yamaneta kehen and Y. paquini contained almost identical truncated tRNAs, and their intergenic spacers and overlaps exhibited high uniformity. The two Yamaneta species also possessed a higher similarity of start/stop codons for PCGs than the two Trogloneta species. In selective pressure analysis, compared to Yamaneta, Trogloneta had much higher Ka/Ks values, which implies that selection pressure may be affected by habitat changes. In our study, the phylogenetic analysis based on the combination of 13 PCGs and two rRNAs showed that Mysmenidae is a sister clade to the family Tetragnathidae. Our data and findings will contribute to the better understanding of the origin and evolution of mysmenid spiders. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Genomes,Mitogenome,Illumina,Illumina,Novaseq 6000 ,"Low coverage, mitogenomes",Low coverage

Shapiro,10.3390/genes8120403,,Genes,,2017,"Rapa Nui is one of the most remote islands in the world. As a young island, its biota is a consequence of both natural dispersals over the last ~1 million years and recent human introductions. It therefore provides an opportunity to study a unique community assemblage. Here, we extract DNA from museum-preserved and newly field-collected spiders from the genus Tetragnatha to explore their history on Rapa Nui. Using an optimized protocol to recover ancient DNA from museum-preserved spiders, we sequence and assemble partial mitochondrial genomes from nine Tetragnatha species, two of which were found on Rapa Nui, and estimate the evolutionary relationships between these and other Tetragnatha species. Our phylogeny shows that the two Rapa Nui species are not closely related. One, the possibly extinct, T. paschae, is nested within a circumtropical species complex (T. nitens), and the other (Tetragnatha sp. Rapa Nui) appears to be a recent human introduction. Our results highlight the power of ancient DNA approaches in identifying cryptic and rare species, which can contribute to our understanding of the global distribution of biodiversity in all taxonomic lineages. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Genomes,Mitogenome,Illumina,Illumina,MiSeq,"Low coverage, Museomics",Low coverage

Esposito,10.1093/zoolinnean/zlaf007,,Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society,,2025,"The mesh-web weaver family Dictynidae s.l. has been labelled a 'tailor's drawer' family because it contains taxonomically unorganized and often evolutionarily distant species. Previous molecular phylogenetic studies using limited taxonomic sampling and legacy target genes involving representatives of the family have been consistent in: (i) exhibiting low branch support values and (ii) the recovery of genera and species currently classified as dictynids outside of Dictynidae. The genera within the family and the relationships among dictynid genera have never been rigorously tested using genomic-scale data. Here, we use exemplar dictynid species from the most currently recognized dictynid genera and ultraconserved elements (UCEs) recovered in silico from low-coverage, whole-genome sequencing plus Sanger data to resolve the phylogenetic placement and relationships of genera within the family Dictynidae s.l.

Webs of intrigue: museum genomics elucidate relationships of the marronoid spider clade (Araneae),J. A. Gorneau; S. C. Crews; F. Cala-Riquelme; K. O. Montana; J. C. Spagna; F. Ballarin; L. M. Almeida-Silva; L. A. Esposito,10.1093/isd/ixad021,,Insect Systematics and Diversity,,2023,"Relationships among spider families that lack support through other lines of evidence (e.g., morphology) have recently been uncovered through molecular phylogenetics. One such group is the marronoid""clade, which contains about 3,400 described species in 9 families. Marronoids run the gamut of life history strategies, with social species, species producing a variety of silk types, and species occurring in a range of extreme environments. Despite recognition of the ecological variability in the group, there remains uncertainty about family- level relationships, leaving diverse ecologies without an evolutionary context. The phylogenies produced to date have relatively low nodal support, there are few defined morphological synapomorphies, and the internal relationships of many families remain unclear. We use 93 exemplars from all marronoid families and ultraconserved element loci captured in silico from a combination of 48 novel low-coverage whole genomes and genomic data from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) to produce a 50% occupancy matrix of 1,277 loci from a set of ultraconserved element probes.

Schramm,10.3389/fmicb.2020.01845,,Frontiers in Microbiology,,2020,"Social spiders have remarkably low species-wide genetic diversities, potentially increasing the relative importance of microbial symbionts for host fitness. Here we explore the bacterial microbiomes of three species of social Stegodyphus (S. dumicola, S. mimosarum, and S. sarasinorum), within and between populations, using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The microbiomes of the three spider species were distinct but shared similarities in membership and structure. This included low overall diversity (Shannon index 0.5–1.7), strong dominance of single symbionts in individual spiders (McNaughton’s dominance index 0.68–0.93), and a core microbiome (>50% prevalence) consisting of 5–7 specific symbionts. The most abundant and prevalent symbionts were classified as Chlamydiales, Borrelia, and Mycoplasma, all representing novel, presumably Stegodyphus-specific lineages. Borrelia- and Mycoplasma-like symbionts were localized by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in the spider midgut. The microbiomes of individual spiders were highly similar within nests but often very different between nests from the same population, with only the microbiome of S. sarasinorum consistently reflecting host population structure. The weak population pattern in microbiome composition renders microbiome-facilitated local adaptation unlikely. However, the retention of specific symbionts across populations and species may indicate a recurrent acquisition from environmental vectors or an essential symbiotic contribution to spider phenotype. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Ecological interactions,Microbiome,Illumina,Illumina,MiSeq,Metabarcoding,Amplicon seq

Urbanization as a facilitator of gene flow in a human health pest,L. S. Miles; J. C. Johnson; R. J. Dyer; B. C. Verrelli,10.1111/mec.14783,,Molecular Ecology,,2018,"Urban fragmentation can reduce gene flow that isolates populations, reduces genetic diversity and increases population differentiation, all of which have negative conservation implications. Alternatively, gene flow may actually be increased among urban areas consistent with an urban facilitation model. In fact, urban adapter pests are able to thrive in the urban environment and may be experiencing human-mediated transport. Here, we used social network theory with a population genetic approach to investigate the impact of urbanization on genetic connectivity in the Western black widow spider, as an urban pest model of human health concern. We collected genomewide single nucleotide polymorphism variation from mitochondrial and nuclear double-digest RAD (ddRAD) sequence data sets from 210 individuals sampled from 11 urban and 10 nonurban locales across its distribution of the Western United States. From urban and nonurban contrasts of population, phylogenetic, and network analyses, urban locales have higher within-population genetic diversity, lower between-population genetic differentiation and higher estimates of genetic connectivity. Social network analyses show that urban locales not only have more connections, but can act as hubs that drive connectivity among nonurban locales, which show signatures of historical isolation.

Hedin,10.1016/j.ympev.2021.107165,,Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution,,2021,"Introgressive hybridization can be a powerful force impacting patterns of evolution at multiple taxonomic levels. We aimed to understand how introgression has affected speciation and diversification within a species complex of jumping spiders. The Habronattus americanus subgroup is a recently radiating group of jumping spiders, with species now in contact after hypothesized periods of isolation during glaciation cycles of the Pleistocene. Effects of introgression on genomes and morphology were investigated using phylogenomic and clustering methods using RADseq, ultraconserved elements (UCEs), and morphological data. We characterized 14 unique species/morphs using non-metric multidimensional scaling of morphological data, a majority of which were not recovered as monophyletic in our phylogenomic analyses. Morphological clusters and genetic lineages are highly incongruent, such that geographic region was a greater predictor of phylogenetic relatedness and genomic similarity than species or morph identity. STRUCTURE analyses support this pattern, revealing clusters corresponding to larger geographic regions. A history of rapid radiation in combination with frequent introgression seems to have mostly homogenized the genomes of species in this system, while selective forces maintain distinct male morphologies. GEMMA analyses support this idea by identifying SNPs correlated with distinct male morphologies. Overall, we have uncovered a system at odds with a typical bifurcating evolutionary model, instead supporting one where closely related species evolve together connected through multiple introgression events, creating a reticulate evolutionary history. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Pop genomics,Hybridization,Illumina,Illumina,HiSeq4000,RAD-seq,RAD-seq

Pétillon,10.1093/isd/ixad018,,Insect Systematics and Diversity,,2023,"Holarctic species offer great opportunities to study biogeography, phylogenetics, taxonomy, and local adaptation. Species that are considered conspecific between the Palearctic and the Nearctic realms are often split into 2 or more species when denser sampling and molecular markers are applied. Similar in complexity but at a finer geographical scale are species groups having Arctic-Alpine distributions where lineages have complicated demographic histories due to glacial dynamics. In both cases, allopatric speciation might not result in fast differentiation of morphological characters if environmental conditions in isolated areas are similar and the main driver of variability is genetic drift. Here, we study the Holarctic Pardosa hyperborea (Thorell, 1872) and its closest European relatives to assess their taxonomic status and patterns of genetic variability. Based on DNA barcodes and genomic data from double-digest restriction site associated sequencing, we propose that the North American populations should be regarded as a distinct species (P. luteola Emerton,1894, stat. resurr.), possibly consisting of several independent lineages. With the help of D-statistics, population genetic simulations and phylogenetic networks analysis, we demonstrate historical introgression among European species of the group and a likely explanation for shared DNA barcodes among allopatric and fully differentiated species.

This problem is especially critical in the case of phylogeographically structured organisms, with allopatric populations showing similar divergence patterns as species. Here, we assess the species limits and phylogeography of Zodarion alacre, an ant-eating spider widely distributed across the Iberian Peninsula. We first performed species delimitation based on genome-wide data and then validated these results using additional evidence. A commonly employed species delimitation strategy detected four distinct lineages with almost no admixture, which present allopatric distributions. These lineages showed ecological differentiation but no clear morphological differentiation, and evidence of introgression in a mitochondrial barcode. Phylogenomic networks found evidence of substantial gene flow between lineages. Finally, phylogeographic methods highlighted remarkable isolation by distance and detected evidence of range expansion from south-central Portugal to central-north Spain. We conclude that despite their deep genomic differentiation, the lineages of Z. alacre do not show evidence of complete speciation. Our results likely shed light on why Zodarion is among the most diversified spider genera despite its limited distribution and support the use of gene flow evidence to inform species boundaries. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Pop genomics,Species delimitation,Illumina,Illumina,NextSeq 500,RAD-seq,RAD-seq

Dianat,10.1016/j.ympev.2024.108167,,Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution,,2024,"Disentangling the genomic intricacies underlying speciation and the causes of discordance between sources of evidence can offer remarkable insights into evolutionary dynamics. The ant-eating spider Zodarion nitidum, found across the Middle East and Egypt, displays yellowish and blackish morphs that co-occur sympatrically. These morphs additionally differ in behavioral and physiological features and show complete pre-mating reproductive isolation. In contrast, they possess similar sexual features and lack distinct differences in their mitochondrial DNA. We analyzed both Z. nitidum morphs and outgroups using genome-wide and additional mitochondrial DNA data. The genomic evidence indicated that Yellow and Black are reciprocally independent lineages without signs of recent admixture. Interestingly, the sister group of Yellow is not Black but Z. luctuosum, a morphologically distinct species. Genomic gene flow analyses pinpointed an asymmetric nuclear introgression event, with Yellow contributing nearly 5 % of its genome to Black roughly 320,000 years ago, intriguingly aligning with the independently estimated origin of the mitochondrial DNA of Black. We conclude that the blackish and yellowish morphs of Z. nitidum are long-diverged distinct species, and that the ancient and modest genomic introgression event registered resulted in a complete mitochondrial takeover of Black by Yellow. This investigation underscores the profound long-term effects that even modest hybridization events can have on the genome of organisms. It also exemplifies the utility of phylogenetic networks for estimating historical events and how integrating independent lines of evidence can increase the reliability of such estimations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Pop genomics,Hybridization,Illumina,Illumina,NextSeq 500,RAD-seq,RAD-seq

The spider is less sensitive to many insecticides than the target pests such as the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens. The different sensitivity to a certain insecticide between species is mostly attributed to the differences in both molecular targets and detoxification enzymes. As one of the most important detoxification enzymes, glutathione transferases (GSTs) play a key role as phase II enzyme in the enzymic detoxification in organisms. Until now, there are few studies on spiders' GSTs, limiting the understanding of insecticide selectivity between insect pests and natural enemy spiders. In this study, based on the transcriptome and genome sequencing of P. pseudoannulata, thirteen full-length transcripts encoding GSTs were identified and analyzed. Interestingly, Delta family, which is thought to be specific to the Insecta, was identified in P. pseudoannulata. Further, vertebrate/mammalian-specific Mu family was also identified in P. pseudoannulata. The mRNA expression levels of cytosolic GSTs in different tissues were determined, and most GST genes were abundant in the gut and the fat body. To investigate GST candidates involving in insecticide detoxification, the mRNA levels of cytosolic GSTs were tested after spiders' exposure to either imidacloprid or deltamethrin. The results showed that PpGSTD3 and PpGSTT1 responded to at least one of these two insecticides.

Bond,10.1111/1755-0998.13894,,Molecular Ecology Resources,,2024,"The outcome of species delimitation depends on many factors, including conceptual framework, study design, data availability, methodology employed and subjective decision making. Obtaining sufficient taxon sampling in endangered or rare taxa might be difficult, particularly when non-lethal tissue collection cannot be utilized. The need to avoid overexploitation of the natural populations may thus limit methodological framework available for downstream data analyses and bias the results. We test species boundaries in rare North American trapdoor spider genus Cyclocosmia Ausserer (1871) inhabiting the Southern Coastal Plain biodiversity hotspot with the use of genomic data and two multispecies coalescent model methods. We evaluate the performance of each methodology within a limited sampling framework. To mitigate the risk of species over splitting, common in taxa with highly structured populations, we subsequently implement a species validation step via genealogical diversification index (gdi), which accounts for both genetic isolation and gene flow. We delimited eight geographically restricted lineages within sampled North American Cyclocosmia, suggesting that major river drainages in the region are likely barriers to dispersal. Our results suggest that utilizing BPP in the species discovery step might be a good option for datasets comprising hundreds of loci, but fewer individuals, which may be a common scenario for rare taxa. However, we also show that such results should be validated via gdi, in order to avoid over splitting. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Phylogenomics,Shallow,Illumina,Illumina,HiSeq2500,Target-cap (AHE),Target-cap

Here, we reconstruct the origin and subsequent dispersal of coin spiders (Nephilidae: Herennia Thorell), a clade of 14 species inhabiting tropical Asia and Australasia. Specifically, we test whether the all-Asian range of Herennia multipuncta is natural vs. anthropogenic. We combine Anchored Hybrid Enrichment phylogenomic and classical marker phylogenetic data to infer species and population phylogenies. Our biogeographical analyses follow two alternative dispersal models: ballooning vs. walking. Following these assumptions and considering measured distances between geographical areas through temporal intervals, these models infer ancestral areas based on varying dispersal probabil-ities through geological time. We recover a wide ancestral range of Herennia including Australia, mainland SE Asia and the Philippines. Both models agree that H. multipuncta internal splits are generally too old to be influenced by humans, thereby implying its natural colonisation of Asia, but suggest quite different colonisation routes of H. multipuncta populations. The results of the ballooning model are more parsimonious as they invoke fewer chance dispersals over large distances. We speculate that coin spiders’ ancestor may have lost the ability to balloon, but that H. multipuncta regained it, thereby colonising and maintaining larger areas. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Phylogenomics,Shallow,Illumina,Illumina,HiSeq2500,Target-cap (AHE),Target-cap

Here, we use Anchored Hybrid Enrichment (AHE) to gather hundreds of loci from across the genome for reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships among the nine genera and test the monophyly of the family. We also reconstruct the possible ancestral ranges of the most inclusive clade recovered. Using AHE, we generate a supermatrix of 565 loci and 115,209 bp for 27 individuals. For the first time, analyses using all nine genera produce results definitively establishing the non-monophyly of Ctenizidae. A lineage formed exclusively by representatives of South African Stasimopus was placed as the sister group to the remaining taxa in the tree, and the Mediterranean Cteniza and Cyrtocarenum were recovered with high support as sister to exemplars of Euctenizidae, Migidae, and Idiopidae.

Lemmon,10.3897/zookeys.695.13852,,ZooKeys,,2017,"We present the first genome-wide molecular phylogeny of jumping spiders (Araneae: Salticidae), inferred from Anchored Hybrid Enrichment (AHE) sequence data. From 12 outgroups plus 34 salticid taxa representing all but one subfamily and most major groups recognized in previous work, we obtained 447 loci totalling 96,946 aligned nucleotide sites. Our analyses using concatenated likelihood, parsimony, and coalescent methods (ASTRAL and SVDQuartets) strongly confirm most previous results, resolving as monophyletic the Spartaeinae, Salticinae (with the hisponines sister), Salticoida, Amycoida, Saltafresia, and Simonida. The agoriines, previously difficult to place beyond subfamily, are finally placed confidently within the saltafresians as relatives of the chrysillines and hasariines. Relationships among the baviines, astioids, marpissoids, and saltafresians remain uncertain, though our analyses tentatively conclude the first three form a clade together. Deep relationships, among the seven subfamilies, appear to be largely resolved, with spartaeines, lyssomanines, and asemoneines forming a clade. In most analyses, Onomastus (representing the onomastines) is strongly supported as sister to the hisponines plus salticines. Overall, the much-improved resolution of many deep relationships despite a relatively sparse taxon sample suggests AHE is a promising technique for salticid phylogenetics. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Phylogenomics,Shallow,Illumina,Illumina,HiSeq2500,Target-cap (AHE),Target-cap
Expanding anchored hybrid enrichment to resolve both deep and shallow relationships within the spider tree of life,C. A. Hamilton; A. R. Lemmon; E. M. Lemmon; J. E. Bond,10.1186/s12862-016-0769-y,,BMC Evolutionary Biology,,2016,"Background: Despite considerable effort, progress in spider molecular systematics has lagged behind many other comparable arthropod groups, thereby hindering family-level resolution, classification, and testing of important macroevolutionary hypotheses. Recently, alternative targeted sequence capture techniques have provided molecular systematics a powerful tool for resolving relationships across the Tree of Life. One of these approaches, Anchored Hybrid Enrichment (AHE), is designed to recover hundreds of unique orthologous loci from across the genome, for resolving both shallow and deep-scale evolutionary relationships within non-model systems. Herein we present a modification of the AHE approach that expands its use for application in spiders, with a particular emphasis on the infraorder Mygalomorphae. Results: Our aim was to design a set of probes that effectively capture loci informative at a diversity of phylogenetic timescales. Following identification of putative arthropod-wide loci, we utilized homologous transcriptome sequences from 17 species across all spiders to identify exon boundaries. Conserved regions with variable flanking regions were then sought across the tick genome, three published araneomorph spider genomes, and raw genomic reads of two mygalomorph taxa. Following development of the 585 target loci in the Spider Probe Kit, we applied AHE across three taxonomic depths to evaluate performance: deep-level spider family relationships (33 taxa, 327 loci); family and generic relationships within the mygalomorph family Euctenizidae (25 taxa, 403 loci); and species relationships in the North American tarantula genus Aphonopelma (83 taxa, 581 loci). At the deepest level, all three major spider lineages (the Mesothelae, Mygalomorphae, and Araneomorphae) were supported with high bootstrap support. Strong support was also found throughout the Euctenizidae, including generic relationships within the family and species relationships within the genus Aptostichus. As in the Euctenizidae, virtually identical topologies were inferred with high support throughout Aphonopelma. Conclusions: The Spider Probe Kit, the first implementation of AHE methodology in Class Arachnida, holds great promise for gathering the types and quantities of molecular data needed to accelerate an understanding of the spider Tree of Life by providing a mechanism whereby different researchers can confidently and effectively use the same loci for independent projects, yet allowing synthesis of data across independent research groups. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Phylogenomics,"Deep, shallow",Illumina,Illumina,HiSeq2500,Target-cap (AHE),Target-cap

In this study, we applied a phylogenomic approach using ultra-conserved elements (UCE) obtained from 145 taxa to infer the phylogeny of euophryine jumping spiders. The results provide a well-supported phylogenetic framework for Euophryini, especially for the deeper relationships, in which the monophyly of Euophryini, as well as most clades corresponding to a genus or a group of closely related genera, are strongly supported. Additionally, the evolutionary patterns of male embolus length and female copulatory duct length of 117 euophryine species were investigated through ancestral character state reconstruction and phylogenetically independent contrast analyses using the UCE phylogenetic framework. The results suggest strongly that the evolution of the lengths of male embolus and female copulatory duct in Euophryini is positively correlated. The common ancestor of Euophryini likely had relatively short embolus and copulatory duct, followed by repeated lengthening or shortening of both structures in different lineages. Possible mechanisms that may have caused this intersexual coevolution pattern in Euophryini are discussed.

Maddison; J. Zhang,10.1111/cla.12597,,Cladistics,,2024,"The Laufeia clade is a peculiar lineage of euophryine jumping spiders showing rapid divergence of male genital structures, especially the embolic complex that directly interacts with female genitalia during sperm transfer. With the rapid growth of species discovery and the perplexing morphology of male genitalia in the Laufeia clade, the controversy in its classification has become a crucial problem. In this study, we applied a phylogenomic approach using ultra-conserved elements data to infer the phylogeny of the Laufeia clade with extensive taxon sampling. A comparative morphological study was performed to evaluate diagnostic characters and understand the evolution of the male embolic complex within the Laufeia clade. The evolution of microhabitats (foliage, tree trunk, rock and surface litter) was also investigated to uncover the potential link between the microhabitat shifts and male embolic complex divergence. The results provide a strongly supported phylogenetic framework and updated generic concepts for the Laufeia clade. The synapomorphies for the updated genera within the Laufeia clade were identified through character mapping on the phylogeny. Ancestral state reconstruction analyses revealed that the Type I embolic complex (characterized by a disc-like embolic disc with a lamina as its outer edge) was ancestral and gradually evolved into the Type II (without lamina of embolic disc, base of embolic complex often modified into a functional “conductor”) and Type III (lacking lamina of embolic disc and base of embolic complex) embolic complex, and that some embolic shapes evolved multiple times independently in different lineages of the Laufeia clade. The shift from foliage-dwelling to tree trunk-dwelling in the common ancestor of the Laufeia clade may have facilitated the divergent evolution of male embolic complex in the Laufeia clade.

A novel probe set for the phylogenomics and evolution of RTA spiders,J. Zhang; Z. Li; J. Lai; Z. Zhang; F. Zhang,10.1111/cla.12523,,Cladistics,,2023,"Spiders are important models for evolutionary studies of web building, sexual selection and adaptive radiation. The recent development of probes for UCE (ultra-conserved element)-based phylogenomic studies has shed light on the phylogeny and evolution of spiders. However, the two available UCE probe sets for spider phylogenomics (Spider and Arachnida probe sets) have relatively low capture efficiency within spiders, and are not optimized for the retrolateral tibial apophysis (RTA) clade, a hyperdiverse lineage that is key to understanding the evolution and diversification of spiders. In this study, we sequenced 15 genomes of species in the RTA clade, and using eight reference genomes, we developed a new UCE probe set (41 845 probes targeting 3802 loci, labelled as the RTA probe set). The performance of the RTA probes in resolving the phylogeny of the RTA clade was compared with the Spider and Arachnida probes through an in-silico test on 19 genomes. We also tested the new probe set empirically on 28 spider species of major spider lineages. The results showed that the RTA probes recovered twice and four times as many loci as the other two probe sets, and the phylogeny from the RTA UCEs provided higher support for certain relationships. This newly developed UCE probe set shows higher capture efficiency empirically and is particularly advantageous for phylogenomic and evolutionary studies of RTA clade and jumping spiders. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Phylogenomics,Deep,Illumina,Illumina,NovaSeq,Target-cap (UCE),Target-cap

Sanger sequencing legacy data can also be important for understanding evolutionary relationships. The possibility of combining genomic, morphological and Sanger data in one analysis seems compelling, permitting a more complete sampling and yielding a comprehensive view of the evolution of a group. Here we used these three data types to elucidate the systematics and evolution of the Dionycha, a highly diverse group of spiders relatively underrepresented in phylogenetic studies. The datasets were analyzed separately and combined under different inference methods, including a novel approach for analyzing morphological matrices with commonly used evolutionary models. We tested alternative hypotheses of relationships and performed simulations to investigate the accuracy of our findings. We provide a comprehensive and thorough phylogenetic hypothesis for Dionycha that can serve as a robust framework to test hypotheses about the evolution of key characters. We also show that morphological data might have a phylogenetic impact, even when massively outweighed by molecular data. Our approach to analyze morphological data may serve as an alternative to the proposed practice of arbitrarily partitioning, weighting, and choosing between parsimony and stochastic models. As a result of our findings, we propose Trachycosmidae new rank for a group of Australian genera formerly included in Trochanteriidae and Gallieniellidae, and consider Ammoxenidae as a junior synonym of Gnaphosidae.

The base of the araneomorph tree also concentrates the greatest number of changes in respiratory structures, a character system whose evolution is still poorly understood, and that might be related to the evolution of silk glands. Emphasizing a dense sampling of multiple araneomorph lineages where tracheal systems likely originated, we gathered genomic-scale data and reconstructed a phylogeny of true spiders. This robust phylogenomic framework was used to conduct maximum likelihood and Bayesian character evolution analyses for respiratory systems, silk glands, and aerial webs, based on a combination of original and published data. Our results indicate that in true spiders, posterior book lungs were transformed into morphologically similar tracheal systems six times independently, after the evolution of novel silk gland systems and the origin of aerial webs. From these comparative data, we put forth a novel hypothesis that early-diverging web-building spiders were faced with new energetic demands for spinning, which prompted the evolution of similar tracheal systems via convergence; we also propose tests of predictions derived from this hypothesis. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Phylogenomics,Deep,Illumina,Illumina,HiSeq2500,Target-cap (UCE),Target-cap

A genome-wide molecular phylogeny of 23 sitticine species, using more than 700 loci from the arachnid Ultra-Conserved Element (UCE) probeset, confirms the Neotropical origins of sitticines, whose basal divergence separates the new subtribe Aillutticina (a group of five Neotropical genera) from the subtribe Sitticina (five genera of Eurasia and the Americas). The phylogeny shows that most Eurasian sitticines form a relatively recent and rapid radiation, which we unite into the genus Attulus Simon, 1868, consisting of the subgenera Sitticus Simon, 1901 (seven described species), Attulus (41 described species), and Sittilong Prószynski, 2017 (one species). Five species of Attulus occur natively in North America, presumably through dispersals back from the Eurasian radiation, but an additional three species were more recently introduced from Eurasia. Attus palustris Peckham & Peckham, 1883 is considered to be a full synonym of Euophrys floricola C. L. Koch, 1837 (not a distinct subspecies). Attus sylvestris Emerton, 1891 is removed from synonymy and recognized as a senior synonym of Sitticus magnus Chamberlin & Ivie, 1944. Thus, the five native Attulus in North America are Attulus floricola, A. sylvestris, A. cutleri, A. striatus, and A. finschi. The other sitticines of Canada and the U.S.A. are placed in separate genera, all of which arose from a Neotropical radiation including Jollas Simon, 1901 and Tomis F.O.Pickard-Cambridge, 1901: (1) Attinella Banks, 1905 (A. dorsata, A. concolor, A. juniperi), (2) Tomis (T. welchi), and (3) Sittisax Prószynski, 2017 (S. ranieri). All Neotropical and Caribbean “Sitticus” are transferred to either Jollas (12 species total) or Tomis (14 species). Attinella (three species) and Tomis are both removed from synonymy with Sitticus; the synonymy of Sitticus cabellensis Proószyński, 1971 with Pseudattulus kratochvili Caporiacco, 1947 is restored; Pseudattulus Caporiacco, 1947 is synonymized with Tomis. Six generic names are newly synonymized with Attulus and one with Attinella. Two Neotropical species are described as new, Jollas cupreus sp. nov. and Tomis manabita sp. nov. Forty-six new combinations are established and three are restored. Three species synonymies are restored, one is new, and two are rejected. Across this diversity of species is a striking diversification of chromosome complements, with X-autosome fusions occurring at least four times to produce neo-Y sex chromosome systems (X<inf>1</inf>X<inf>2</inf>Y and X<inf>1</inf>X<inf>2</inf>X<inf>3</inf>Y), some of which (Sittisax ranieri and S. saxicola) are sufficiently derived as to no longer preserve the simple traces of ancestral X material.

Northwestern Bexar County, Texas (USA), is an example of a region where urbanization threatens an essential karst landscape. Many studies have provided substantial contributions to the understanding and conservation of biodiversity in this area, including the delineation of Karst Fauna Regions (KFRs). However, no study has evaluated fundamentally important measures of genetic diversity, changes in population sizes, and gene flow for listed regional species. Here we used population genomic data derived from the sequence capture of ultraconserved elements (UCEs) to describe patterns of structure and connectivity among cave populations of Cicurina madla, and to estimate demographic and phylogeographic processes underlying those patterns. In addition, we evaluated if population genetic processes could have been influenced by human activities. Although there is weak phylogenomic differentiation between populations, the distribution of genetic diversity and patterns of gene flow within and between areas suggest important differences in population dynamics among KFRs. Our genomic data show that populations of C. madla in Bexar County currently carry comparatively low levels of heterozygosity and nucleotide diversity, and that these might have been influenced by human activities. Ultimately, we present genomic evidence for declining cave spider population sizes perhaps coincident with increases in an expanding human population and discuss implications of our findings for conservation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Pop genomics,Phylogeography,Illumina,Illumina,HiSeq,Target-cap (UCE),Target-cap

At time of description the genus was known from fewer than 20 individuals, with sparse natural history information suggesting a vagrant, web-building, litter-dwelling natural history. Here the first published taxonomic and natural history information for this taxon is provided in more than 50 years, working from extensive new geographic sampling, consideration of male and female morphology, and sequence capture-based nuclear phylogenomics and mitogenomics. Several new species are easily diagnosed based on distinctive male morphologies, while a complex of populations from central and northern Arizona required an integrative combination of genomic algorithmic species de-limitation analyses and morphological study. Four new species are described, including H. ephedra sp. nov., H. uwiiltil sp. nov., H. xerica sp. nov., and H. zas sp. nov. Females of H. encina Gertsch & Platnick, 1979 are also described for the first time. It is predicted that additional new species will ultimately be found in the mountains of central and northwestern Arizona, northern mainland Mexico, and the Mojave Desert of California. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Pop genomics,Species delimitation,Illumina,Illumina,HiSeq4000,Target-cap (UCE),Target-cap
"Comparative Population Genomic Diversity and Differentiation in Trapdoor Spiders and Relatives (Araneae, Mygalomorphae)",R. Monjaraz-Ruedas; J. Starrett; L. Newton; J. Bond; M. Hedin,10.1111/mec.17540,,Molecular Ecology,,2024,"Although patterns of population genomic variation are well-studied in animals, there remains room for studies that focus on non-model taxa with unique biologies. Here we characterise and attempt to explain such patterns in mygalomorph spiders, which are generally sedentary, often occur as spatially clustered demes and show remarkable longevity. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data were collected for 500 individuals across a phylogenetically representative sample of taxa. We inferred genetic populations within focal taxa using a phylogenetically informed clustering approach, and characterised patterns of diversity and differentiation within- and among these genetic populations, respectively. Using phylogenetic comparative methods we asked whether geographical range sizes and ecomorphological variables (behavioural niche and body size) significantly explain patterns of diversity and differentiation. Specifically, we predicted higher genetic diversity in genetic populations with larger geographical ranges, and in small-bodied taxa. We also predicted greater genetic differentiation in small-bodied taxa, and in burrowing taxa. We recovered several significant predictors of genetic diversity, but not genetic differentiation. However, we found generally high differentiation across genetic populations for all focal taxa, and a consistent signal for isolation-by-distance irrespective of behavioural niche or body size. We hypothesise that high population genetic structuring, likely reflecting combined dispersal limitation and microhabitat specificity, is a shared trait for all mygalomorphs. Few studies have found ubiquitous genetic structuring for an entire ancient and species-rich animal clade. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Pop genomics,Genetic diversity,Illumina,Illumina,HiSeq4000,Target-cap (UCE),Target-cap

Morphological, genomic, behavioral, and distributional data were used to report the discovery of a remarkable new tarantula species from this range. Aphonopelma jacobii sp. nov. inhabits high-elevation mixed conifer forests in these mountains, but also co-occurs and shares its breeding period with A. chiricahua—a related member of the Marxi species group—in mid-elevation Madrean evergreen oak and pine-oak woodlands. This marks the first documented case of syntopy between two montane endemics in the Madrean Archipelago and adds to our knowledge of this threatened region’s unmatched tarantula diversity in the United States. An emended diagnosis and redescription for A. chiricahua are also provided based on several newly acquired and accurately identified specimens. Phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial and genomic-scale data reveal that A. jacobii sp. nov. is more closely related to A. marxi, a species primarily distributed on the Colorado Plateau, than to A. chiricahua or the other Madrean Sky Island taxa.

The species of one of its constituent lineages, the family Anapidae, build a remarkable diversity of webs (ranging from orbs to sheet webs and irregular tangles) and even include a webless kleptoparasitic species. Anapids are also exceptional because of the extraordinary diversity of their respiratory systems. The phylogenetic relationships of symphytognathoid families have been recalcitrant with different classes of data, such as, monophyletic with morphology and its concatenation with Sanger-based six markers, paraphyletic (including a paraphyletic Anapidae) with solely Sanger-based six markers, and polyphyletic with transcriptomes. In this study, we capitalized on a large taxonomic sampling of symphytognathoids, focusing on Anapidae, and using de novo sequenced ultraconserved elements (UCEs) combined with UCEs recovered from available transcriptomes and genomes. We evaluated the conflicting relationships using a variety of support metrics and topology tests. We found support for the phylogenetic hypothesis proposed using morphology to obtain the “symphytognathoids'' clade, Anterior Tracheal System (ANTS) Clade and monophyly of the family Anapidae. Anapidae can be divided into three major lineages, the Vichitra Clade (including Teutoniella, Holarchaea, Sofanapis and Acrobleps), the subfamily Micropholcommatinae and the Orb-weaving anapids (Owa) Clade. Biogeographic analyses reconstructed a hypothesis of multiple long-distance transoceanic dispersal events, potentially influenced by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and West Wind Drift. In symphytognathoids, the ancestral anterior tracheal system transformed to book lungs four times and reduced book lungs five times. The posterior tracheal system was lost six times.

J. P. Croucher; M. S. Brewer; C. J. Winchell; G. S. Oxford; R. G. Gillespie,10.1186/1471-2164-14-862,,BMC Genomics,,2013,"Background: A number of spider species within the family Theridiidae exhibit a dramatic abdominal (opisthosomal) color polymorphism. The polymorphism is inherited in a broadly Mendelian fashion and in some species consists of dozens of discrete morphs that are convergent across taxa and populations. Few genomic resources exist for spiders. Here, as a first necessary step towards identifying the genetic basis for this trait we present the near complete transcriptomes of two species: the Hawaiian happy-face spider Theridion grallator and Theridion californicum. We mined the gene complement for pigment-pathway genes and examined differential expression (DE) between morphs that are unpatterned (plain yellow) and patterned (yellow with superimposed patches of red, white or very dark brown). Results: By deep sequencing both RNA-seq and normalized cDNA libraries from pooled specimens of each species we were able to assemble a comprehensive gene set for both species that we estimate to be 98-99% complete. It is likely that these species express more than 20,000 protein-coding genes, perhaps 4.5% (ca. 870) of which might be unique to spiders. Mining for pigment-associated Drosophila melanogaster genes indicated the presence of all ommochrome pathway genes and most pteridine pathway genes and DE analyses further indicate a possible role for the pteridine pathway in theridiid color patterning. Conclusions: Based upon our estimates, T. grallator and T. californicum express a large inventory of protein-coding genes. Our comprehensive assembly illustrates the continuing value of sequencing normalized cDNA libraries in addition to RNA-seq in order to generate a reference transcriptome for non-model species. The identification of pteridine-related genes and their possible involvement in color patterning is a novel finding in spiders and one that suggests a biochemical link between guanine deposits and the pigments exhibited by these species. © 2013 Croucher et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. © 2014 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Functional genomics,Colour polymorphism,Illumina,Illumina,HiSeq2000,Transcriptome,Transcriptome

Next-generation transcriptomics and proteomics provide unparalleled, but underexploited, capabilities for venom characterization. We combined multi-tissue RNA-Seq with mass spectrometry and bioinformatic analyses to determine venom gland specific transcripts and venom proteins from the Western black widow spider (Latrodectus hesperus) and investigated their evolution. Results: We estimated expression of 97,217 L. hesperus transcripts in venom glands relative to silk and cephalothorax tissues. We identified 695 venom gland specific transcripts (VSTs), many of which BLAST and GO term analyses indicate may function as toxins or their delivery agents. ~38% of VSTs had BLAST hits, including latrotoxins, inhibitor cystine knot toxins, CRISPs, hyaluronidases, chitinase, and proteases, and 59% of VSTs had predicted protein domains. Latrotoxins are venom toxins that cause massive neurotransmitter release from vertebrate or invertebrate neurons.

Liu,10.1111/1744-7917.12305,,Insect Science,,2016,"Tarantula venoms provide a model system for studying toxin selectivity, structure-activity relationships and molecular evolution of peptide toxins. Previous studies have identified a large number of peptide toxins in the venom of the Chinese bird spider Haplopelma hainanum, generally regarded as a highly venomous spider. However, the lack of available RNA-seq transcriptomic and genomic data is an obstacle to understanding its venom at the molecular level. In this study, we investigated the venom gland transcriptome of H. hainanum by RNA-seq, in the absence of an available genomic sequence. We identified 201 potential toxins among 57 181 de novo assembled transcripts, including knottins, Kunitz-type toxins, enzymes and other proteins. We systematically identified most of the knottins and Kunitz-type toxins, some of which showed strongly biased expression in the venom gland, including members of the huwentoxin-1, huwentoxin-2 and magi-1 families. We also discovered several novel potential toxins. These data demonstrate the high molecular and structural diversity in the venom toxins of H. hainanum.

Long-read transcriptomic analysis of orb-weaving spider Araneus ventricosus indicates transcriptional diversity of spidroins,S. Y. Zhou; Q. L. Dong; K. S. Zhu; L. Gao; X. Chen; H. Xiang,10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.11.182,,International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,,2021,"Spider silk, which is composed of diverse silk proteins (spidroin), is a kind of natural high-mass biomaterial with great potential. However, due to the complexity of both the structure and the composition of the spidroins in natural spider silk, application of this valuable biomass is still limited to date. There are diverse kinds of spider silk in the orb-weaving spider with different mechanical and structural characteristics. In order to systematically illustrate the landscape of all the different spidrons, here we chose Araneus ventricosus, an orb-weaving spider with superior silk mechanical features and genome information, to generate a long-read whole body transcriptome. We deciphered the repeat arrangements of each kind of spidroin, based on which we found that there are substantially transcriptional diversity of each spidroin gene. Some repeat motifs are not documented before. Specifically, we discovered novel full-lengh MaSp transcript as well as a relatively small full-length AcSp isoforms, which are potential promising materials for bioengineering of recombinant spidroin. Our study provided a batch of new spidron resources with detail sequential information. The finding of transcriptional diversity may provide cues in understanding of within-species variation of the mechanical properties of the natural spider silk and further molecular designing of recombinant spidroin. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Functional genomics,Silk genes,Illumina,Illumina,HiSeq,Transcriptome,Transcriptome

Linksvayer,10.1038/s41467-022-34446-8,,Nature Communications,,2022,"The transition from solitary to social life is a major phenotypic innovation, but its genetic underpinnings are largely unknown. To identify genomic changes associated with this transition, we compare the genomes of 22 spider species representing eight recent and independent origins of sociality. Hundreds of genes tend to experience shifts in selection during the repeated transition to social life. These genes are associated with several key functions, such as neurogenesis, behavior, and metabolism, and include genes that previously have been implicated in animal social behavior and human behavioral disorders. In addition, social species have elevated genome-wide rates of molecular evolution associated with relaxed selection caused by reduced effective population size. Altogether, our study provides unprecedented insights into the genomic signatures of social evolution and the specific genetic changes that repeatedly underpin the evolution of sociality.

In addition, no overarching phylogeny of araneids is available to date, hampering further comparative work. In this study, we analyze the transcriptomes of 33 taxa, including 19 araneids – 12 of them new to this study – representing most of the core family lineages, to examine the relationships within the family using genomic-scale datasets resulting from various methodological treatments, namely ortholog selection and gene occupancy as a measure of matrix completion. Six matrices were constructed to assess these effects by varying orthology inference method and gene occupancy threshold. Orthology methods used are the benchmarking tool BUSCO and the tree-based method UPhO; three gene occupancy thresholds (45%, 65%, 85%) were used to assess the effect of missing data. Gene tree and species tree-based methods (including multi-species coalescent and concatenation approaches, as well as maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference) were used totalling 17 analytical treatments. The monophyly of Araneidae and the placement of core araneid lineages were supported, together with some previously unsound backbone divergences; these include high support for Zygiellinae as the earliest diverging subfamily (followed by Nephilinae), the placement of Gasteracanthinae as sister group to Cyclosa and close relatives, and close relationships between the Araneus + Neoscona clade and Cyrtophorinae + Argiopinae clade. Incongruences were relegated to short branches in the clade comprising Cyclosa and its close relatives. We found congruence between most of the completed analyses, with minimal topological effects from occupancy/missing data and orthology assessment. The resulting number of genes by certain combinations of orthology and occupancy thresholds being analyzed had the greatest effect on the resulting trees, with anomalous outcomes recovered from analysis of lower numbers of genes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Phylogenomics,Deep,Illumina,Illumina,HiSeq2500,Transcriptome,Transcriptome
Early Cretaceous greenhouse pumped higher taxa diversification in spiders,L. Shao; S. Li,10.1016/j.ympev.2018.05.026,,Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution,,2018,"The Cretaceous experienced one of the most remarkable greenhouse periods in geological history. During this time, ecosystem reorganization significantly impacted the diversification of many groups of organisms. The rise of angiosperms marked a major biome turnover. Notwithstanding, relatively little remains known about how the Cretaceous global ecosystem impacted the evolution of spiders, which constitute one of the most abundant groups of predators. Herein, we evaluate the transcriptomes of 91 taxa representing more than half of the spider families. We add 23 newly sequenced taxa to the existing database to obtain a robust phylogenomic assessment. Phylogenetic reconstructions using different datasets and methods obtain novel placements of some groups, especially in the Synspermiata and the group having a retrolateral tibial apophysis (RTA). Molecular analyses indicate an expansion of the RTA clade at the Early Cretaceous with a hunting predatory strategy shift. Fossil analyses show a 7-fold increase of diversification rate at the same period, but this likely owes to the first occurrence of spiders in amber deposit. Additional analyses of fossil abundance show an accumulation of spider lineages in the Early Cretaceous. We speculate that the establishment of a warm greenhouse climate pumped the diversification of spiders, in particular among webless forms tracking the abundance of insect prey. Our study offers a new pathway for future investigations of spider phylogeny and diversification. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Phylogenomics,Deep,Illumina,Illumina,?,Transcriptome,Transcriptome
"Phylogenomics, Diversification Dynamics, and Comparative Transcriptomics across the Spider Tree of Life",R. Fernández; R. J. Kallal; D. Dimitrov; J. A. Ballesteros; M. A. Arnedo; G. Giribet; G. Hormiga,10.1016/j.cub.2018.03.064,,Current Biology,,2018,"Dating back to almost 400 mya, spiders are among the most diverse terrestrial predators [1]. However, despite considerable effort [1–9], their phylogenetic relationships and diversification dynamics remain poorly understood. Here, we use a synergistic approach to study spider evolution through phylogenomics, comparative transcriptomics, and lineage diversification analyses. Our analyses, based on ca. 2,500 genes from 159 spider species, reject a single origin of the orb web (the “ancient orb-web hypothesis”) and suggest that orb webs evolved multiple times since the late Triassic–Jurassic. We find no significant association between the loss of foraging webs and increases in diversification rates, suggesting that other factors (e.g., habitat heterogeneity or biotic interactions) potentially played a key role in spider diversification. Finally, we report notable genomic differences in the main spider lineages: while araneoids (ecribellate orb-weavers and their allies) reveal an enrichment in genes related to behavior and sensory reception, the retrolateral tibial apophysis (RTA) clade—the most diverse araneomorph spider lineage—shows enrichment in genes related to immune responses and polyphenic determination. This study, one of the largest invertebrate phylogenomic analyses to date, highlights the usefulness of transcriptomic data not only to build a robust backbone for the Spider Tree of Life, but also to address the genetic basis of diversification in the spider evolutionary chronicle. Fernández et al. use a synergistic approach to study spider evolution through phylogenomics, comparative transcriptomics, and lineage diversification analyses. The “ancient orb web” hypothesis was rejected. Loss of foraging webs was not strongly associated to spider diversification.

The origins of the Psechridae: Web-building lycosoid spiders,D. Q. Cheng; W. H. Piel,10.1016/j.ympev.2018.03.035,,Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution,,2018,"Psechrids are an enigmatic family of S.E. Asian spiders. This small family builds sheet webs and even orb webs, yet unlike other orb weavers, its putative relatives are largely cursorial lycosoids – a superfamily of approximately seven spider families related to wolf spiders. The orb web was invented at least twice: first in a very ancient event, and then second, within this clade of wolf-like spiders that reinvented this ability. Exactly how the spiders modified their silks, anatomy, and behaviors to accomplish this transition requires that we identify their precise evolutionary origins – yet, thus far, molecular phylogenies show poor support and considerable disagreement. Using phylogenomic methods based on whole body transcriptomes for psechrids and their putative relatives, we have recovered a well-supported phylogeny that places the Psechridae sister to the Ctenidae – a family of mostly cursorial habits but that, as with all psechrids, retains some cribellate species. Although this position reinforces the prevailing view that orb weaving in psechrids is largely a consequence of convergence, it is still possible that some components of this behavior are retained or resurrected in common with more distant true orb weaving ancestors. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Phylogenomics,Deep,Illumina,Illumina,HiSeq4000,Transcriptome,Transcriptome

Egg sac, prey capture thread, or dragline silk possesses characteristic mechanical properties, and its variability makes it a highly attractive material for ecological, evolutional, and industrial fields. However, the complete set of constituents of silks produced by a single species is still unclear, and novel spidroin genes as well as other proteins are still being found. Here, we present the first genome in genus Araneus together with the full set of spidroin genes with unamplified long reads and confirmed with transcriptome of the silk glands and proteome analysis of the dragline silk. The catalogue includes the first full length sequence of a paralog of major ampullate spidroin MaSp3, and several spider silk-constituting elements designated SpiCE. Family-wide phylogenomic analysis of Araneidae suggests the relatively recent acquisition of these genes, and multiple-omics analyses demonstrate that these proteins are critical components in the abdominal spidroin gland and dragline silk, contributing to the outstanding mechanical properties of silk in this group of species. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Genomes,Scaffold,"Illumina, ONT",ONT,?,Hybrid,

Their success is often attributed to key developments in their evolution such as silk and venom production and major apomorphies such as a whole-genome duplication. Resolving deep relationships within the spider tree of life has been historically challenging, making it difficult to measure the relative importance of these novelties for spider evolution. Whole-genome data offer an essential resource in these efforts, but also for functional genomic studies. Here, we present de novo assemblies for three spider species: Ryuthela nishihirai (Liphistiidae), a representative of the ancient Mesothelae, the suborder that is sister to all other extant spiders; Uloborus plumipes (Uloboridae), a cribellate orbweaver whose phylogenetic placement is especially challenging; and Cheiracanthium punctorium (Cheiracanthiidae), which represents only the second family to be sequenced in the hyperdiverse Dionycha clade. These genomes fill critical gaps in the spider tree of life. Using these novel genomes along with 25 previously published ones, we examine the evolutionary history of spidroin gene and structural hox cluster diversity.

Liu,10.1016/j.ibmb.2022.103862,,Insect Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,,2022,"Spiders impress us with their sophisticated use of silk and the stunningly distinct silk proteins (spidroins) in each spider species. Understanding how silks and spidroins function and evolve within the spider world is one profound interest to expand our knowledge on spider evolution. Spidroins are characterized with the divergent repeat core region flanked with the relatively conserved N- and C-terminus. The structure and number of the repeats contribute to the unique mechanical properties of the spidroin and the silk. Spidroins have been intensively studied in web-weaver spiders, but information regarding their diversity in wandering spiders remains scarce. Here, twenty spidroin genes were identified in the pond wolf spider, Pardosa pseudoannulata, belonging to the retrolateral tibial apophysis (RTA) clade. These spidroins were categorized into four classes, including twelve ampullate spidroin (AmpSp), four aciniform spidroin (AcSp), one tubuliform spidroin (TuSp), one pyriform spidroin (PiSp), and two spidroin-like proteins. Multiple copies of the AmpSp and AcSp genes were tandemly arranged in a cluster within the genome, and the N-terminal domains and repetitive sequences of the proximately located spidroins were highly similar, suggesting that the spidroin genes diversified via tandem duplication. Only four types of morphologically distinct silk glands were found in P. pseudoannulata, namely Ma, Mi, Ac, and Pi glands, consistent with the glandular affiliation hypothesis that spidroins co-evolved with glandular specialization to fit species-specific needs. Expression profiling revealed that the single tubuliform spidroin (TuSp) gene was highly expressed in gravid females and two AcSp genes displayed synchronous expression. Knock-down of the TuSp gene via RNAi resulted in fragile and cracked eggsacs and prolonged the female pre-oviposition period, validating its importance in spider reproduction. The genome-scale characterization and functional study of spidroin genes allows associating the presence of specific spidroins with silk utility in P. pseudoannulata and will expand our knowledge of spider evolution. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Genomes,Chromosome-level,"Illumina, PacBio",PacBio,?,Hi-C,

The genomic consequences and persistence of sociality in spiders,J. Ma; J. Bechsgaard; A. Aagaard; P. Villesen; T. Bilde; M. H. Schierup,10.1101/gr.279503.124,,Genome Research,,2025,"In cooperatively breeding social animals, a few individuals account for all reproduction. In some taxa, sociality is accompanied by a transition from outcrossing to inbreeding. In concert, these traits reduce effective population size, potentially rendering transitions to sociality “evolutionarily dead-ends.” We addressed this hypothesis in a comparative genomic study in spiders, in which sociality has evolved independently at least 23 times, but social branches are recent and short. We present genomic evidence for the evolutionary dead-end hypothesis in a spider genus with three independent transitions to sociality. We assembled and annotated high-quality, chromosome-level reference genomes from three pairs of closely related social and subsocial Stegodyphus species. We timed the divergence between the social and subsocial species pairs to be from 1.3 million to 1.8 million years. Social evolution in spiders involves a shift from outcrossing to inbreeding and from an equal to a female-biased sex ratio, causing severe reductions in effective population size and decreased efficacy of selection. We show that transitions to sociality only had full effect on purifying selection at 119, 260, and 279 kya, respectively, and follow similar convergent trajectories of progressive loss of diversity and shifts to an increasingly female-biased sex ratio. This almost deterministic genomic response to sociality may explain why social spider lineages do not persist. What causes species extinction is not clear, but either could be selfish meiotic drive eliminating the production of males or could be an inability to retain genome integrity in the face of extremely reduced efficacy of selection. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Genomes,Chromosome-level,"Illumina, PacBio",PacBio,?,Hi-C,

Our de novo assembly (1.36 Gb), which represents 80% of the genome size estimated by flow cytometry (1.7 Gb), is constituted by a high fraction of interspersed repetitive elements (53.8%). The assembly completeness, using BUSCO and core eukaryotic genes, ranges from 90% to 96%. Functional annotations based on both ab initio and evidence-based information (including D. silvatica RNA sequencing) yielded a total of 48,619 protein-coding sequences, of which 36,398 (74.9%) have the molecular hallmark of known protein domains, or sequence similarity with Swiss-Prot sequences. The D. silvatica assembly is the first representative of the superfamily Dysderoidea, and just the second available genome of Synspermiata, one of the major evolutionary lineages of the true spiders"" (Araneomorphae). Conclusions: Dysderoids, which are known for their numerous instances of adaptation to underground environments, include some of the few examples of trophic specialization within spiders and are excellent models for the study of cryptic female choice. This resource will be therefore useful as a starting point to study fundamental evolutionary and functional questions, including the molecular bases of the adaptation to extreme environments and ecological shifts, as well of the origin and evolution of relevant spider traits, such as the venom and silk. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.""",,,,,Genomes,Scaffold,"Illumina, PacBio",PacBio,?,Hybrid,

"Hooroo mates! Phylogenomic data suggest that the closest relatives of the iconic Tasmanian cave spider Hickmania troglodytes are in Australia and New Zealand, not in South America",S. Kulkarni; G. Hormiga,10.1071/IS21030,,Invertebrate Systematics,,2021,"Hickmania troglodytes is an emblematic cave spider representing a monotypic cribellate spider genus. This is the only Australian lineage of Austrochilidae while the other members of the family are found in southern South America. In addition to being the largest spider in Tasmania, Hickmania is an oddity in Austrochilidae because this is the only lineage in the family bearing posterior book lungs, tarsal spines and an embolar process on male pedipalps. Six-gene Sanger sequences and genome scale data such as ultraconserved elements (UCEs) and transcriptomes have suggested that Hickmania troglodytes is not nested with the family of current classification, Austrochilidae. We studied the phylogenetic placement of Hickmania troglodytes using an increased taxon sample by combining publicly available UCE and UCEs recovered from transcriptomic data in a parsimony and maximum likelihood framework. Based on our phylogenetic results we formally transfer Hickmania troglodytes from Austrochilidae to the family Gradungulidae.

Hormiga,10.1093/molbev/msaa251,,Molecular Biology and Evolution,,2021,"Genome-scale data sets are converging on robust, stable phylogenetic hypotheses for many lineages; however, some nodes have shown disagreement across classes of data. We use spiders (Araneae) as a system to identify the causes of incongruence in phylogenetic signal between three classes of data: exons (as in phylotranscriptomics), noncoding regions (included in ultraconserved elements [UCE] analyses), and a combination of both (as in UCE analyses). Gene orthologs, coded as amino acids and nucleotides (with and without third codon positions), were generated by querying published transcriptomes for UCEs, recovering 1,931 UCE loci (codingUCEs). We expected that congeners represented in the codingUCE and UCEs data would form clades in the presence of phylogenetic signal. Noncoding regions derived from UCE sequences were recovered to test the stability of relationships. Phylogenetic relationships resulting from all analyses were largely congruent. All nucleotide data sets from transcriptomes, UCEs, or a combination of both recovered similar topologies in contrast with results from transcriptomes analyzed as amino acids. Most relationships inferred from low-occupancy data sets, containing several hundreds of loci, were congruent across Araneae, as opposed to high occupancy data matrices with fewer loci, which showed more variation. Furthermore, we found that low-occupancy data sets analyzed as nucleotides (as is typical of UCE data sets) can result in more congruent relationships than high occupancy data sets analyzed as amino acids (as in phylotranscriptomics). Thus, omitting data, through amino acid translation or via retention of only high occupancy loci, may have a deleterious effect in phylogenetic reconstruction. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Phylogenomics,Deep,In silico,In silico,?,"Target-cap (UCE), Transcriptome",Target-cap

Insight into the adaptive role of arachnid genome-wide duplication through chromosome-level genome assembly of the Western black widow spider,L. S. Miles; H. Waterman; N. A. Ayoub; J. E. Garb; R. A. Haney; M. S. Rosenberg; T. J. Krabbenhoft; B. C. Verrelli,10.1093/jhered/esae018,,Journal of Heredity,,2024,"Although spiders are one of the most diverse groups of arthropods, the genetic architecture of their evolutionary adaptations is largely unknown. Specifically, ancient genome-wide duplication occurring during arachnid evolution ~450 mya resulted in a vast assembly of gene families, yet the extent to which selection has shaped this variation is understudied. To aid in comparative genome sequence analyses, we provide a chromosome-level genome of the Western black widow spider (Latrodectus hesperus)-a focus due to its silk properties, venom applications, and as a model for urban adaptation. We used long-read and Hi-C sequencing data, combined with transcriptomes, to assemble 14 chromosomes in a 1.46 Gb genome, with 38,393 genes annotated, and a BUSCO score of 95.3%. Our analyses identified high repetitive gene content and heterozygosity, consistent with other spider genomes, which has led to challenges in genome characterization. Our comparative evolutionary analyses of eight genomes available for species within the Araneoidea group (orb weavers and their descendants) identified 1,827 single-copy orthologs. Of these, 155 exhibit significant positive selection primarily associated with developmental genes, and with traits linked to sensory perception. These results support the hypothesis that several traits unique to spiders emerged from the adaptive evolution of ohnologs-or retained ancestrally duplicated genes-from ancient genome-wide duplication. These comparative spider genome analyses can serve as a model to understand how positive selection continually shapes ancestral duplications in generating novel traits today within and between diverse taxonomic groups. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Genomes,Chromosome-level,ONT,ONT,?,?,

Egg case silk gene sequences from Argiope Spiders: Evidence for multiple loci and a loss of function between paralogs,R. C. Chaw; M. Collin; M. Wimmer; K. L. Helmrick; C. Y. Hayashi,10.1534/g3.117.300283,,"G3: Genes, Genomes, Genetics",,2018,"Spiders swath their eggs with silk to protect developing embryos and hatchlings. Egg case silks, like other fibrous spider silks, are primarily composed of proteins called spidroins (spidroin = spider-fibroin). Silks, and thus spidroins, are important throughout the lives of spiders, yet the evolution of spidroin genes has been relatively understudied. Spidroin genes are notoriously difficult to sequence because they are typically very long (≥ 10 kb of coding sequence) and highly repetitive. Here, we investigate the evolution of spider silk genes through long-read sequencing of Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) clones. We demonstrate that the silver garden spider Argiope argentata has multiple egg case spidroin loci with a loss of function at one locus. We also use degenerate PCR primers to search the genomic DNA of congeneric species and find evidence for multiple egg case spidroin loci in other Argiope spiders. Comparative analyses show that these multiple loci are more similar at the nucleotide level within a species than between species. This pattern is consistent with concerted evolution homogenizing gene copies within a genome. More complicated explanations include convergent evolution or recent independent gene duplications within each species. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Functional genomics,Silk genes,PacBio ,PacBio,RSII,BAC,

Sánchez-Gracia; M. A. Arnedo; J. Rozas,10.7717/peerj.1064,,PeerJ,,2015,"The funnel-web spider Macrothele calpeiana is a charismatic Mygalomorph with a great interest in basic, applied and translational research. Nevertheless, current scarcity of genomic and transcriptomic data of this species clearly limits the research in this non-model organism. To overcome this limitation, we launched the first tissue-specific enriched RNA-seq analysis in this species using a subtractive hybridization approach, with two main objectives, to characterize the specific transcriptome of the putative chemosensory appendages (palps and first pair of legs), and to provide a new set of DNA markers for further phylogenetic studies. We have characterized the set of transcripts specifically expressed in putative chemosensory tissues of this species, much of them showing features shared by chemosensory system genes. Among specific candidates, we have identified some members of the iGluR and NPC2 families. Moreover, we have demonstrated the utility of these newly generated data as molecular markers by inferring the phylogenetic position M. calpeina in the phylogenetic tree of Mygalomorphs. Our results provide novel resources for researchers interested in spider molecular biology and systematics, which can help to expand our knowledge on the evolutionary processes underlying fundamental biological questions, as species invasion or biodiversity origin and maintenance. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Functional genomics,Chemosensory,Pyrosequencing,Pyrosequencing,454 GS-FLX Titanium,Transcriptome,Transcriptome
